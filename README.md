## Generate a Wallet Seed and Store it in KeepassXC

This project was built on stream in this video: [https://youtu.be/NqrEW0dFdrk](https://youtu.be/NqrEW0dFdrk).

You're going to have to install [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/) on your machine. If you're on Linux or *BSD, you can use your operating system's package manager.
If you are on macOS, I recommend that you install KeePassXC using Homebrew, this way the `keepassxc-cli` command will be available in your `PATH` out of the box.
If you are on Windows, install KeePassXC inside WSL2 or play around with your `PATH`.
